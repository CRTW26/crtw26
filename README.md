### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


While studying Modern Languages I realised there were tools that could have made mine and my fellow studentâ€™s lives easier. I wanted to learn how to build these tools and so I made the transition to becoming a developer. I am now looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, working on projects that benefit people.
